Hi, Welcome to my Github Profile!
I am a data analytics enthusiast dedicated to transforming raw data into meaningful insights.
About me:
I love diving into data, uncovering trends, and telling stories through numbers. I am good(on the way to become more proficient) with tools named MS Excel, SQL, Power BI & Tableau, constantly exploring new methodologies, tools, and technologies to enhance my data analytics skills.
I have created few repositories showcasing my proficiency with the tools, have a look at those :)
